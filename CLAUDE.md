# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **awesome-crewai** repository - a curated list of open-source projects built by the CrewAI community. It's a documentation-only repository (no code) that serves as a central directory for discovering CrewAI-related projects, integrations, and tutorials.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new project to the list
When adding projects, ensure they meet the submission guidelines:
- Must be open-source projects by individual developers or small teams
- Cannot be commercial services or company-led projects
- Add entries to the appropriate section table in README.md:14-73

### Reviewing pull requests
Check that submissions:
1. Follow the table format exactly (Title | Description | Author)
2. Include working GitHub links
3. Meet the open-source criteria (not commercial)
4. Are placed in the correct category section

## Repository Structure

- **Single-file architecture**: All content is in README.md
- **No build process**: Pure Markdown documentation
- **Categories**: Integrations, Tutorials, Apps/UIs
- **Table format**: Each project entry requires Title (with link), Description, and Author (with GitHub profile)

## Contribution Workflow

1. Contributors fork the repository
2. Add their project to the relevant section in README.md
3. Submit a pull request
4. Maintainers review for eligibility criteria

## Important Notes

- This is NOT a code repository - avoid suggesting build commands, tests, or code improvements
- Commercial projects should be directed to the CrewAI ecosystem website form (README.md:41)
- Maintain consistent table formatting and section structure when editing
